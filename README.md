# movie-picker#
This is a pure Java command line app that works with a movie database in a .csv file to provide the user the possibility to search in that database and get movie recommendations.

Installation on Windows 11 with PowerShell 5.1 (see version with 'Get-Host' command):
- have Maven and JDK installed (I have Maven 3.8.7. and JDK 17.0.5)
- check if Maven is installed and is accessible ('mvn --version'). You should see the version number appear.
- check if JDK is installed and is accessible ('java --version'). You should see the version number appear.
- git clone <ssh-link-to-repo> <target-folder>
- 'cd' into target folder
- 'mvn compile'
- 'mvn package'
- 'java -jar .\target\<full-name-of-compiled-file-with-jar-extension>'
